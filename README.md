# demo-docs

This folder contains examples of agentic tool usage for composing research documents.

Intitial examples were generated using Cursor IDE with web tools just before OpenAI and others made their Deep Research tools more affordable / accessible.

Later I added reports generated by ChatGPT and Perplexity and allowed Claude to illustrate some drafts with diagrams.

Latest update: document generated by Gemini Deep Research that just provided opportunity to launch a few research queries for free.
