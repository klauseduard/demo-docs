## Intellectual Property

**Summary:** Viking Therapeutics' intellectual property portfolio is primarily based on licensing agreements with Ligand Pharmaceuticals, which provide the company with exclusive worldwide rights to develop and commercialize its key programs. These agreements include milestone payments and royalty structures that impact the company's long-term economics.

### Licensing Agreements

Viking Therapeutics obtained an exclusive worldwide license to five novel therapeutic programs from Ligand Pharmaceuticals in May 2014. This foundational agreement covers several of Viking's current pipeline assets, including:

- VK2809 (TRÎ² Agonist program for NASH/MASH)
- VK0214 (TRÎ² Agonist for X-ALD)
- VK5211 (SARM program for muscle wasting)
- VK0612 (FBPase inhibitor for type 2 diabetes)
- EPOR Agonist program for anemia
- DGAT-1 Inhibitor program for dyslipidemia

Under the terms of this license agreement with Ligand, Viking is responsible for all development activities. The agreement includes milestone payments and royalty structures:

- Ligand is entitled to receive a $10 million milestone payment upon initiation of a Phase 3 clinical trial for VK2809
- Ligand will receive royalties of 3.5% to 7.5% on future worldwide sales of VK2809 and other licensed programs

*Source: [Viking Therapeutics SEC Filings, 10-K Annual Report](https://ir.vikingtherapeutics.com/sec-filings/annual-reports)*

### VK2735 Intellectual Property

VK2735, Viking's dual GLP-1/GIP receptor agonist for obesity and metabolic disorders, appears to be wholly owned by Viking Therapeutics and was developed internally, separate from the Ligand licensing agreement. This represents a significant strategic advantage as the company would not owe milestone payments or royalties to Ligand on this program.

### Patent Protection

Viking's intellectual property strategy includes:

1. **Licensed Patents:** Rights to patents covering the five programs licensed from Ligand
2. **Method-of-Use Patents:** Protection for specific therapeutic applications
3. **Formulation Patents:** Coverage for unique drug formulations, including the oral tablet formulation of VK2735
4. **Manufacturing Process Patents:** Protection for proprietary manufacturing methods

The company's patent strategy aims to provide market exclusivity for its key programs, though specific expiration dates for individual patents are not publicly disclosed in detail.

### Strategic Implications

The intellectual property portfolio has several implications for Viking's business strategy:

1. **Royalty Obligations:** The Ligand agreement creates ongoing financial obligations for certain programs but provided Viking with a strong initial pipeline
2. **VK2735 Advantage:** The company's most advanced obesity program appears to be free from external royalty obligations
3. **Patent Lifecycle Management:** Viking continues to file new patents to extend protection as programs advance through clinical development

The company's intellectual property position supports its pipeline development strategy while providing a foundation for potential future partnerships or commercialization efforts.
