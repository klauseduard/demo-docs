## **5\. Risk Assessment**

Viking Therapeutics faces several risks inherent to the biotechnology industry. **Clinical risks** include the possibility that ongoing or future clinical trials may not be successful in meeting their primary or secondary endpoints 8. Safety or tolerability issues could also emerge during these trials, potentially leading to delays or termination of development 8. VK2735, in particular, has shown gastrointestinal side effects such as nausea and vomiting in its Phase 2 VENTURE study 11, which will require careful monitoring in larger, longer-term studies. Delays in clinical trial timelines are also a potential risk that could affect the company’s overall progress 180.  
**Regulatory risks** are significant for any company seeking to bring a new drug to market. There is no guarantee that Viking’s drug candidates will receive regulatory approval from the FDA or other health authorities, even if clinical trial results are positive 8. Clinical holds can be placed on trials, as seen with a competitor’s program 181, and changes in regulatory requirements or delays in the approval process can impact timelines and increase costs 8. The experiences of competitors in the X-ALD space, with Skysona facing regulatory scrutiny 64 and Leriglitazone receiving an EMA refusal 124, highlight the unpredictable nature of the regulatory landscape.  
**Commercial risks** include the uncertainty of market adoption for new therapies, even if approved 180. Viking faces substantial competition in the obesity and NASH markets from established pharmaceutical companies and other emerging therapies 9. Pricing pressures and challenges in securing favorable reimbursement from payers can also affect the profitability of Viking’s products 94. Additionally, potential disruptions in the supply chain could impact the launch and availability of its products 4.  
From a **financial perspective**, Viking Therapeutics is currently operating at a net loss and relies on external funding to support its research and development activities 6. The company will likely need to undertake further stock offerings, which could lead to dilution of existing shareholders’ equity, to fund the costly Phase 3 trials and potential commercialization efforts 74. The significant prepayment of $150 million to CordenPharma for manufacturing capacity 4 represents a substantial financial commitment that will impact the company’s cash flow over the next few years.

## **6\. Investment Analysis**

Viking Therapeutics’ valuation metrics indicate high market expectations for its pipeline. As of March 11, 2025, the company had a market capitalization of $3.3 billion 1, which had been as high as $3.7 billion in February 2025 180 and $3.14 billion as of March 10, 2025 185. The stock has experienced significant volatility, with a 52-week trading range of $24.41 to $89.10 1. Due to its clinical-stage nature and lack of significant product revenue, the company’s Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio is negative 75. The Price to Book (P/B) ratio was 4.73 as of the end of 2023 76 and 6.28 according to one investment analysis 52. These metrics suggest that the current valuation is heavily influenced by the potential future success of Viking’s drug candidates, particularly VK2735.  
A comparable analysis reveals the significant potential upside if Viking’s lead programs are successful. Competitors in the obesity market, such as Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly, have substantially larger market capitalizations 86. Madrigal Pharmaceuticals, which recently gained approval for the first NASH drug, had a market cap of $1.2 billion as of January 2024 74. Positive results from Phase 3 trials for VK2735 could lead to a significant increase in Viking’s valuation, potentially aligning it more closely with its larger peers. Similarly, the valuation of Madrigal post-Rezdiffra approval offers a potential benchmark for VK2809.  
The investment thesis for Viking Therapeutics presents a compelling but risky opportunity. The company’s strengths include promising Phase 2 data for VK2735 in the large and rapidly growing obesity market, with the potential for best-in-class efficacy. The development of both subcutaneous and oral formulations for VK2735 offers a broader market opportunity. Additionally, VK2809 has shown strong Phase 2b results in NASH, demonstrating significant liver fat reduction and histologic improvements. VK0214 also holds promise in the rare disease space of X-ALD, addressing a high unmet need. The company’s strong cash position provides a financial runway for near-term development, and the management team has relevant experience. However, the weaknesses include the company’s clinical-stage status with no current product revenue, a high burn rate, significant competition in its target markets, the inherent risks of clinical trial failure and regulatory hurdles, and the potential for future stock dilution.  
Based on the comprehensive risk assessment, Viking Therapeutics would likely be considered a **high-risk** investment due to its clinical-stage nature and the inherent uncertainties of drug development.  
Potential dilution factors include the likely need for additional funding to support the expensive Phase 3 trials and the eventual commercialization of its drug candidates 74. Historically, the company has utilized stock offerings to raise capital 6.  
Institutional investors hold a significant portion of Viking’s stock, indicating confidence from sophisticated investors 74. Insider ownership is also present 74. However, recent insider selling activity in January 2025 by key executives warrants monitoring 186.  
The potential for a buyout of Viking Therapeutics exists, particularly given the promising data for VK2735 in the high-value obesity market and the strong results for VK2809 in NASH 14. Larger pharmaceutical companies seeking to strengthen their portfolios in these therapeutic areas may find Viking an attractive acquisition target.

## **8\. Conclusion and Recommendations**

Viking Therapeutics presents a compelling investment opportunity within the biotechnology sector, primarily driven by the promising clinical development of its lead drug candidate, VK2735, for obesity. The Phase 2 VENTURE trial demonstrated significant weight loss with both subcutaneous and oral formulations, positioning VK2735 as a potential competitor in a vast and rapidly expanding market dominated by GLP-1 agonists. The planned initiation of Phase 3 trials for the subcutaneous formulation in Q2 2025 represents a critical upcoming catalyst.  
The company’s second lead program, VK2809, targeting NASH, has also shown robust Phase 2b results, achieving key primary and secondary endpoints related to liver fat reduction, NASH resolution, and fibrosis improvement. Given the lack of established treatments for NASH and the significant market size, VK2809 holds substantial potential.  
Additionally, the Phase 1b results for VK0214 in X-ALD are encouraging for addressing a rare disease with high unmet medical need.  
While Viking possesses a strong pipeline and a healthy cash position, it is important to acknowledge the inherent risks associated with clinical-stage biotechnology companies. These risks include potential clinical trial failures, regulatory hurdles, intense competition, and the need for future financing, which could lead to stock dilution.  
**Recommendations:**

* **Monitor Clinical Trial Progress:** Closely track the progress and results of the ongoing Phase 2 oral trial for VK2735 and the planned Phase 3 trials for the subcutaneous formulation. The outcomes of these trials will be critical for the company’s valuation.  
* **Evaluate Competitive Landscape:** Continuously assess the competitive landscape in the obesity and NASH markets, paying attention to the development timelines and efficacy data of competing therapies.  
* **Assess Regulatory Pathway:** Monitor the regulatory pathway for all lead candidates, understanding the requirements and potential challenges for gaining approval in the US and other key markets.  
* **Track Financial Health:** Keep a close watch on the company’s burn rate, cash position, and any future financing activities. The $150 million prepayment to CordenPharma is a significant financial commitment.  
* **Consider Buyout Potential:** While not a primary investment strategy, the potential for acquisition by a larger pharmaceutical company, particularly if Phase 3 data for VK2735 is positive, should be considered.

In conclusion, Viking Therapeutics offers a high-risk, high-reward investment profile. The success of its lead drug candidates in large and underserved markets could generate substantial returns, but investors should be aware of the significant risks involved in biotech drug development.
