### **Clinical Risks**
- Potential failure to meet primary or secondary endpoints in ongoing/future trials
- Safety or tolerability issues (VK2735 showed GI side effects in Phase 2)
- Delays in clinical trial timelines

### **Regulatory Risks**
- No guarantee of regulatory approvals despite positive trial results
- Potential for clinical holds based on competitor experiences
- Changes in regulatory requirements increasing costs or timeline

### **Commercial Risks**
- Uncertain market adoption even if approved
- Substantial competition in obesity and NASH markets
- Pricing pressures and reimbursement challenges
- Potential supply chain disruptions

### **Financial Risks**

## **6. Investment Analysis**

### **Valuation Metrics**
- **Market Capitalization**: $3.3 billion (as of March 11, 2025)
- **52-Week Trading Range**: $24.41 to $89.10
- **Price to Earnings (P/E) Ratio**: Negative (clinical-stage company)
- **Price to Book (P/B) Ratio**: 4.73 (end of 2023); 6.28 (recent)

### **Comparable Analysis**
- Competitors in obesity market (Novo Nordisk, Eli Lilly) have substantially larger market caps
- Madrigal Pharmaceuticals had market cap of $1.2 billion as of January 2024 (post-Rezdiffra approval)

### **Investment Thesis**

**Strengths**:
- Promising Phase 2 data for VK2735 in large, growing obesity market
- Potential for best-in-class efficacy
- Dual formulation strategy (subcutaneous and oral) broadens market opportunity
- Strong Phase 2b results for VK2809 in NASH
- Promising data for VK0214 in X-ALD (high unmet need)
- Strong cash position for near-term development
- Experienced management team

**Weaknesses**:
- Clinical-stage status with no current product revenue
- High burn rate
- Significant competition in target markets
- Inherent risks of clinical trial failure and regulatory hurdles
- Potential for future stock dilution

### **Risk Rating**: High (clinical-stage biotech)

### **Potential Catalysts**
- Phase 3 trial results for VK2735 subcutaneous formulation
- Phase 2 data for oral VK2735
- Regulatory developments for competitors
- Potential for strategic partnerships or acquisition

## **7. Conclusion and Recommendations**

Viking Therapeutics presents a compelling investment opportunity within the biotechnology sector, primarily driven by the promising clinical development of its lead drug candidate, VK2735, for obesity. The Phase 2 VENTURE trial demonstrated significant weight loss with both subcutaneous and oral formulations, positioning VK2735 as a potential competitor in a vast and rapidly expanding market.

The company's second lead program, VK2809, targeting NASH, has also shown robust Phase 2b results. Given the lack of established treatments for NASH and the significant market size, VK2809 holds substantial potential. Additionally, the Phase 1b results for VK0214 in X-ALD are encouraging for addressing a rare disease with high unmet medical need.

### **Recommendations**:

- **Monitor Clinical Trial Progress**: Closely track progress and results of ongoing Phase 2 oral trial for VK2735 and planned Phase 3 trials for subcutaneous formulation
- **Evaluate Competitive Landscape**: Continuously assess competitors in obesity and NASH markets
- **Assess Regulatory Pathway**: Monitor requirements and potential challenges for approval
- **Track Financial Health**: Watch burn rate, cash position, and financing activities
- **Consider Buyout Potential**: While not a primary investment strategy, potential for acquisition increases with positive Phase 3 data

In conclusion, Viking Therapeutics offers a high-risk, high-reward investment profile. The success of its lead drug candidates in large and underserved markets could generate substantial returns, but investors should be aware of the significant risks involved in biotech drug development.
